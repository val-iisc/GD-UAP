###### * = equal contribution 

This repository contains code to craft and evaluate GD-UAP on the following task:

1) Classification.

2) Segmentation.

3) Depth Estimation.

Please look into each of the folders for usage instructions.

## Precomputed Perturbations

Perturbations crafted using the proposed algorithm are provided in this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ixjzg4itx10nhid/perturbations.tar.gz?dl=0). After extracting them, and placing them in the respective folders (In each task), you can use the evaluation code provided in each task for evaluation.
